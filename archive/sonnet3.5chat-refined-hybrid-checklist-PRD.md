Thank you for those detailed answers! Based on this, I can now create a focused implementation checklist that aligns with your MVP-first approach. Let me break this down into clear phases:

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
1. **Firebase Integration**
   - Install Firebase SDK via SPM
   - Configure Firebase project settings
   - Set up basic Auth and Firestore rules
   - Create initial data structure

2. **Basic Project Structure**
   ```
   tiktok/
   ├── Models/
   │   ├── Video.swift
   │   ├── User.swift
   │   └── Comment.swift
   ├── Views/
   │   ├── Feed/
   │   ├── Auth/
   │   └── Player/
   ├── ViewModels/
   │   ├── FeedViewModel.swift
   │   └── AuthViewModel.swift
   └── Services/
       ├── FirebaseService.swift
       └── VideoService.swift
   ```

### Phase 2: Authentication (Week 1, Day 1)
1. **Basic Auth Flow**
   - Email/password signup/login
   - User profile creation in Firestore
   - Auth state management

### Phase 3: Video Feed (Week 1, Days 2-3)
1. **Core Video Feed**
   - Vertical scrolling implementation
   - Video cell design
   - Basic video preloading
   - Auto-play functionality

2. **Video Playback**
   - AVPlayer integration
   - Play/pause controls
   - Progress bar

### Phase 4: Social Features (Week 1, Days 4-5)
1. **Engagement Features**
   - Like functionality with periodic refresh
   - Basic comments system
   - Save/bookmark videos

### Phase 5: Performance & Polish (Week 1, Days 6-7)
1. **Optimization**
   - Video preloading
   - Cache management
   - Smooth scrolling

Would you like me to proceed with creating the first implementation task (Firebase integration and project structure setup), or would you prefer to discuss/modify any part of this plan first?

Also, I noticed in your current codebase that you have a basic SwiftUI setup:

```1:24:tiktok/ContentView.swift
//
//  ContentView.swift
//  tiktok
//
//  Created by gt on 2/3/25.
//

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```


We'll need to modify this significantly to support the vertical scrolling feed. Should we start with that transformation?
